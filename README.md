# Innovative System for Assisting the Visually Impaired Using Jetson Nano

This project is focused on enhancing the lives of blind and visually impaired individuals through a Jetson Nano-powered system that assists with navigation, object recognition, and real-time audio feedback. The solution integrates computer vision and sensor technologies to enhance accessibility and promote independence.

## Project Overview

The system is a portable device, equipped with a camera and sensors, powered by the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It detects and identifies objects and obstacles, providing real-time audio feedback to guide users safely and independently through their environment.

## Key Features

- **Object Recognition**: Uses a camera and deep learning models on the Jetson Nano to identify common objects, alerting the user via audio cues.
- **Obstacle Detection**: Ultrasonic or infrared sensors detect nearby obstacles, preventing collisions.
- **Real-Time Audio Feedback**: Converts visual and sensor data into audio descriptions for the user.
- **Voice Commands**: Users can control the device through voice commands, allowing for a hands-free experience.
